SUMMARY = "Linux container runtime"
DESCRIPTION = "Linux container runtime \
 Docker complements kernel namespacing with a high-level API which \
 operates at the process level. It runs unix processes with strong \
 guarantees of isolation and repeatability across servers. \
 . \
 Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems: \
 large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment \
 systems, private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc. \
 . \
 This package contains the daemon and client, which are \
 officially supported on x86_64 and arm hosts. \
 Other architectures are considered experimental. \
 . \
 Also, note that kernel version 3.10 or above is required for proper \
 operation of the daemon process, and that any lower versions may have \
 subtle and/or glaring issues. \

# Notes:
#   - This docker variant uses moby and the other individually maintained
#     upstream variants for SRCREVs
#   - It is a true community / upstream tracking build, and is not a
#     docker curated set of commits or additions
#   - The version number on this package tracks the versions assigned to
#     the curated docker-ce repository. This allows compatibility and
#     functional equivalence, while allowing new features to be more
#     easily added.
#   - This could be called "docker-moby" or just "moby" in the future, but
#     that would require the creation of a virtual/docker dependency, which
#     is possible, but overkill at the moment (while we wait for the upstream
#     to stop changing).
#   - The common components of this recipe and docker-ce do need to be moved
#     to a docker.inc recipe
